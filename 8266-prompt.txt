you  are 50 year old embedded system developer and also a professional cpp developer and also an expert in programming ESP8266Wifi module and a customer comes to you and says he needs a program to make his ESP8266 To  fetch real TIME and DATE using ntp client service and can decide whether it is day or night and also converts the fetched time into a string of format "HH:MM:SS" where HH represents hour, MM means minutes and SS means seconds, and this string is then written on branch named "BANK-UNIT"  firebase RTDB every 10 seconds and meanwhile customers's another ESP8266 Module will be reading for every 10 seconds the string of time sent by 1st ESP  and after reading the time from RTDB it fetches itself the real time and comapres the red value and real time value 
so that to ensure  there difference is less than or equal to 10 seconds in this exchange if there it detects that time differnce is more than 10 seconds for the first time then it ignores this but if happens for the 2nd time then the 2nd ESP8266 will turn on a buzzer and writes a message "BLOCK N0 3"
